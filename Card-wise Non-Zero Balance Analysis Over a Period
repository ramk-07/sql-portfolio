# üí≥ Non-Zero Balance Card Identification

## üîç Objective
Identify customer cards with a **positive balance** as of June 30, 2025, filtered by specific issuer BINs for targeted business actions like refunds and outreach.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Used
- **card_apps_balance_entries**: Transactional balance entries per card  
- **card**: Card metadata  
- **card_program**: Card to program mapping  
- **issuer_program**: Issuer details including BINs  

## üß† Logic & Approach
1. Aggregate total balance per card up to June 30, 2025  
2. Filter for cards with sum(amount) > 0  
3. Join card, card_program, and issuer_program for enriched info  
4. Filter issuer programs by BIN (`'981254'`, `'896734'`)  

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques
- Subquery aggregation with `SUM()` and `HAVING`  
- Multi-table `INNER JOIN`s  
- Date filtering  
- Conditional filtering with `IN` clause  

## üßæ SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    filtered.card_id AS card_id,
    filtered.amount
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            card_id, 
            SUM(amount) AS amount
        FROM 
            card_apps_balance_entries
        WHERE 
            created_time <= '2025-06-30 18:30:00'
        GROUP BY 
            card_id
        HAVING 
            SUM(amount) > 0
    ) AS filtered
INNER JOIN 
    card ON filtered.card_id = card.card_id
INNER JOIN 
    card_program ON card.card_program_id = card_program.card_program_id
INNER JOIN 
    issuer_program AS issuer_program_id ON card_program.issuer_program_id = issuer_program_id.id
WHERE 
    issuer_program_id.bin IN ('981254', '896734');
