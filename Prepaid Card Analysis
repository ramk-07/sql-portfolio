# üìá Card Metadata by Issuer BIN

## üîç Objective

Retrieve detailed information for all cards issued under specific BINs (`817987`, `817865`) ‚Äî including their status, activation details, customer, and issuer program info. This supports operational reporting, BIN-level audits, and lifecycle tracking.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Tables Used

- **card**: Core card metadata (status, activation, expiry, etc.)  
- **card_program**: Links each card to its issuer program  
- **issuer_program**: Contains issuer-level metadata, including BIN and program name  

---

## üß† Logic & Approach

1. Use a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to join `card`, `card_program`, and `issuer_program`  
2. Filter only for BINs: `'817987'`, `'817865'`  
3. Select key card-level fields: `card_status`, `created_time`, `expired_by`, `card_mode`, etc.  
4. Output clean card metadata, ordered by card creation time

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Used

- `WITH` clause (CTE) for query modularity and readability  
- `INNER JOIN` to enrich card data with issuer and program details  
- `ORDER BY` for chronological sorting  
- Basic filtering with `WHERE` and `IS NOT NULL`  

---

## üí° Business Use Cases

- Generate **BIN-level card lifecycle reports**  
- Track cards by **creation date, activation, or expiry**  
- Use as a base for **audit reports** or **BIN-level KPIs**  
- Segment cards by **issuer program** for deeper analytics  
- Monitor **card mode (physical/virtual)** or **card status trends**
